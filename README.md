# apriltag_image_listener_ros
 
This is the workspace structure of the C++ code for my bachelor's degree project. In this project, a video recorded from a wheeled robot from the DIAG labs was provided, and from this I've created a extension module called apriltag_image_listener (placed inside apriltag_image_listener/src) that was able to build a map from the data coming from the camera of the robot. The robot read the AprilTag tags (https://april.eecs.umich.edu/software/apriltag) as landmarks to store the positions the robot has visited. Furthermore, the power of ROS (Robot Operating System) has been used for this task and g2o (https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o) was used to build and display the actual map. The original thesis is not published for private reasons.
